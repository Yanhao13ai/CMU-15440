    <h1>Formal Analysis of a Centralized Service</h1>
    <p>
        A centralized service can be modeled as a simple queuing system: 
        <strong>reqs → queue → process → response</strong>. The assumptions and notations include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The queue has infinite capacity, so the arrival rate of requests (\( \lambda \)) is not influenced by the current queue length or what is being processed.</li>
        <li>The processing capacity of the service is \( \mu \) requests per second.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Formulas</h2>
    <p>
        The fraction of time having \( k \) requests in the system is defined as:
        \[
        \rho _ { k } = \left( 1 - \frac { \lambda } { \mu } \right) \left( \frac { \lambda } { \mu } \right) ^ { k }
        \]
    </p>
    <p>
        The utilization \( U \) of a service is the fraction of time that it is busy:
        \[
        U = \sum _ { k > 0 } p _ { k } = 1 - \rho _ { 0 } = \frac { \lambda } { \mu } \Rightarrow p _ { k } = ( 1 - U ) U ^ { k }
        \]
    </p>
    <p>
        The average number of requests in the system:
        \[
        N = \sum_{k \geq 0} k \cdot p_k = \sum_{k \geq 0} k \cdot (1-U) U^k = (1-U) \sum_{k \geq 0} k \cdot U^k = \frac{(1-U)U}{(1-U)^2} = \frac{U}{1-U}
        \]
    </p>
    <p>
        The average throughput:
        \[
        X = \underbrace{U \cdot \mu}_{\text{server at work}} + \underbrace{(1 - U) \cdot 0}_{\text{server idle}} = \frac{\lambda}{\mu} \cdot \mu = \lambda
        \]
    </p>
    <p>
        The response time \( R \) (total time taken to process a request after submission), with \( S = \frac{1}{\mu} \) being the service time:
        \[
        R = \frac{\overline{N}}{\overline{X}} = \frac{S}{1-U} \Rightarrow \frac{R}{S} = \frac{1}{1-U}
        \]
    </p>

    <h2>Observations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If \( U \) is small, the response-to-service time ratio (\( \frac{R}{S} \)) is close to 1, meaning a request is immediately processed.</li>
        <li>If \( U \) approaches 1, the system comes to a grinding halt (i.e., the response time \( R \) becomes very large).</li>
    </ul>
